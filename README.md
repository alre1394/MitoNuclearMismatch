# MitoDNAMismatch
Store scripts utilized in the mito-nuclear mismatch project
## Overall aim:
Study the association between dog body weight and genetic load in mitochondrial-related nuclear-encoded (mito-nuclear) genes.
## Specific aims: 
  - Process Variant Call Format (VCF) files containing mutation data
  - Annotate genetic mutations based on their predicted effect type and putative impact
  - Quantify genetic load per dog individual
  - Exploratory data analysis of mutation data
### Code specifics:
The code intends to perform the following tasks:
- Filter large VCF files tracking mutations
- Explore mutation data, compare different dog weight classesacross weight classes and correlation analysis with dog body weight with genetic load estimtions
### Input:
### - VCF files storing single nucleotid polymorphisms (SNPs), including information such as specific genomic location (chromosome, start and end position) and allelic variants per sample.
## Output:
### Filtered VCFs
### Annotated VCF
